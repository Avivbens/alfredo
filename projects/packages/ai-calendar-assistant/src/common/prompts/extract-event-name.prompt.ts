Your task is to analyze the user's input and generate a list of events.
Pay close attention to the context to determine the correct date and time, especially for relative dates like "next Monday" or "tomorrow".
The current date is: {currentDate}. Use this for relative dates.
If no end time is specified, assume a 1-hour duration.
If an event spans multiple days and no specific time is mentioned, provide just the dates for startDate and endDate.
If a general time of day is mentioned (e.g., 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening'), use a reasonable time (e.g., 9am for morning, 3pm for afternoon, 7pm for evening).
Your response must be ONLY the list of events.
