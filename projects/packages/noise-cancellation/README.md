## Description

Toggle noise cancellation on and off directly from Alfred.

> **Note:** Currently, MacOS 26 does not provide a public API for noise cancellation, so this workflow uses private APIs with AppleScripts. Use at your own risk!

## Usage

Use the keyword `nct` to toggle noise cancellation on or off.
